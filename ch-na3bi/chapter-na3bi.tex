%Introduce a little about the Hamiltonian and Xi Dai's theory about Na3Bi

In this chapter we will discuss our transport experiments on the 3D Dirac semimetal Na$_3$Bi. The 3D Dirac semimetal is a three dimensional analog of graphene, with its Dirac node protected against gap-open hybridization. Previous first-principle calculations~\cite{Wang2012} have predicted that both Na$_3$Bi and Cd$_3$As$_2$ are 3D Dirac semimetals in which the Dirac nodes are protected by crystal symmetries. In particular, $C_3$ symmetry prevents the gap opening in Na$_3$Bi. Thus such Dirac nodes in Na$_3$Bi are formed by overlapped Weyl nodes. Also, photoemission experiments have confirmed the linear dispersion in the bulk band and the Fermi arcs on its surface~\cite{Liu2014a, Xu2015, Xu2013}, as shown in Fig. \ref{figNa3Bi_band}(B) and (D). In a magnetic field, the protected nodes of the Dirac semimetal could be sensitive to the breaking of time-reversal invariance and become a Weyl semimetal~\cite{Wang2012}. Many groups~\cite{Son2013,Burkov2011,Hosur2013,Parameswaran2014} predict that, in Dirac and Weyl semimetals, the chiral anomaly effect can lead to many new transport properties in an intense magnetic field $\bf B$, such as novel negative longitudinal magnetoresistance, non-local transport and anomalous Hall effect. To search for these phenomena, we have grown two types of Na$_3$Bi crystals, which have different Fermi levels. And we find that they display very interesting but different transport properties.

Panel (B) shows the linear-dispersed 3D bulk bands from the ARPES experiment \cite{Liu2014a}. It confirms the 3D Dirac nature of Na$_3$Bi. Panel (C) depicts the phase diagram of Na$_3$Bi with different mass terms \cite{Wang2012}. It explains the conditions under which the underlying Weyl branches are separated in momentum space or a gap opens. Panel (D) shows the surface Fermi arcs on Na$_3$Bi in an ARPES experiment \cite{Xu2015}. Fermi arcs are predicted to connect two Weyl nodes, and are signatures of a WSM or DSM. Thus this experimental discovery provides strong support for the theory of the WSM and DSM.

The first type we discuss below has a high $E_F$, which exhibits robust anomalies both in the conductivity and the resistivity when a magnetic field is applied\cite{Xiong2015a}. Specifically, the magnetoresistance follows a $B$-linear shape up to 35 T, while the Hall angle displays an unusual profile approaching a step-function at high fields. Moreover, the conductivities $\sigma_{xx}$ and $\sigma_{xy}$ follow the same power-law in their field dependence when B is large. These findings are unexpected from the conventional transport theory and may arise from a transport lifetime that is very sensitive to the magnetic field. Besides, we also have observed prominent quantum oscillations both in magnetoresistance and the torque magnetometry experiment. Such large oscillations provide an accurate measurement of the Fermi surface and indicate a high mobility in our samples.
%Besides, we also provide some evidence that the Fermi surface may be composed of two distinct valleys, indicating that the Fermi energy may lie below the Lifshitz transition of the bulk Dirac bands.

Our other type of Na$_3$Bi crystals has a much lower chemical potential ($E_F \sim 30$ meV above the Dirac point). As a result, when the Dirac point is split into two chiral Weyl nodes by breaking the time-reversal symmetry in a magnetic field, the proposed charge pumping between the Weyl nodes could be uncovered in transport experiments\cite{Xiong2015b}. This effect is a condensed-matter version of Adler-Bell-Jackiw anomaly ~\cite{Nielsen1983,Wan2011,Burkov2011, Hosur2013} investigated in quantum field theory and high energy physics. Pioneering theoretical work has predicted that charge could flow between the Weyl nodes when an electric field $\bf E$ is applied $\parallel \bf B$, and its strength is determined by $\bf E\cdot \bf B$. Son et. al. ~\cite{Hosur2013} found that with the semiclassical scattering term, the longitudinal conductance in a magnetic field will be enhanced quadratically by the chiral anomaly effect. We will discuss in this chapter our observation of a novel, negative and highly anisotropic magnetoresistance in the Dirac semimetal Na$_3$Bi. We find that the novel negative MR is acutely sensitive to the angle between $\bf B$ and $\bf E$, and is incompatible with conventional transport. To compare with the theoretical prediction, we also rotate both $\bf E$ and $\bf B$, and find that it qualitatively confirms the prediction of the chiral anomaly effect in a semimetal.
