\section{Evidence for Chiral Anomaly in Na$_3$Bi}
\label{sec:na3bi:chiral}

\subsection{Negative Longitudinal Magnetoresistance in Na$_3$Bi}

Besides the above type of Na$_3$Bi with a high carrier density, we have also grown some Na$_3$Bi crystals with a much lowered Fermi energy $E_F$. The crystals were grown in a similar way as we described above, but were annealed for ten weeks before opening the growth tube. The samples are contacted and sealed in a plastic cell inside the argon glovebox before being loaded into the magnet. As shown in Fig.\ref{figWeyl}B, C, the resistivity $\rho$ v.s. $T$ profile displays a non-metallic behavior and the Hall effect indicates a low $n$-type carrier density $n\sim 1\times 10^{17}$ cm$^{-3}$. The Fermi wavevector that corresponds to this carrier density is $k_F = 0.013 \;\rm{\AA}^{-1}$ ($8\times$ smaller than $k_D$). The unusual profiles of $\rho$ and the Hall coefficient $R_H$ in Fig.\ref{figWeyl}C imply the zero-$B$ energy spectrum shown in Fig.\ref{figWeyl}B. The saturation of resistivity below 10 K indicates the dominance of electrons in the conductivity, and the mobility we obtain is $\mu\sim$ 2,600 cm$^2$/(Vs). Due to the zero gap feature of 3D Dirac semimetals, the holes in the valence band are copiously excited even at low $T$. As a result, the Hall coefficient $R_H$ shown in Fig. \ref{figWeyl}C is $n$-type at low temperatures but changes sign above 62K. We could also estimate $E_F$ using the maximum in $R_H$ at 105 K, and it gives a $E_F\sim 3k_BT\sim$ 30 meV.

The excitation of holes in the valence band leads to a sign change in $R_H$ near 70 K and a steep decrease in $\rho$. The inset shows the contact labels and the $x$ and $y$ axes fixed to the sample.

The steep decrease in $\rho_{xx}(B,T)$ at 4.5 K reflects the onset of the axial current in the lowest LL. As $T$ increases, the occupation of higher LLs in conduction and valence bands overwhelms the anomalous term.

Analysis of the observed Shubnikov de Haas (SdH) oscillations (see below) in magnetoresistance also confirms the value of $E_F$ in our Na$_3$Bi samples. Fig. \ref{figSdH}A displays the clear SdH oscillations with a small frequency (a smooth background has been subtracted from the raw data) when $\bf B$ is aligned towards $\bf c$ . Through locating the index field $B_n$ as the extrema of the SdH oscillations, we obtain the Landau index plot in Fig.\ref{figSdH}B. A linear fitting to the index plot yields a FS cross section $S_F$= 4.8$\pm$ 0.3 T, corresponding to $E_F = 29\pm 2$ mV which is in a good agreement with the value from $R_H$. The SdH period also implies that $E_F$ enters the $N$ = 0 LL at $B$ = 6-8 T. 





The density inferred from $S_F$ ($n_e = 1.4\times 10^{17}$ cm$^{-3}$) is slightly higher than $n_H$. We also notice that there is some deviation from the straight line in Fig. \ref{figSdH}B, which may be explained by a $g$-factor comparable to that observed~\cite{Jeon2014} in Cd$_3$As$_2$ by scanning tunneling microcsopy ($g^*\sim$ 40). Such a low $E_F$ suggests that the transport property of the 3D Dirac fermions in Na$_3$Bi crystals can be influenced more seriously by the splitting of Weyl nodes and the resulted charge pumping effect between the nodes.

Panel A shows the Shubnikov oscillations resolved in $\rho_{xx}$ for several tilt angles $\theta$ (relative to $\bf \hat{x}$) after subtraction of the positive $B$-linear MR background (vertical scale as shown). The slope of the plot of the Landau level index $N$ vs. $1/B_n$ where $B_n$ locates the extrema of the oscillations yields $S_F$ = 4.8$\pm$ 0.3 T, $k_F$ = 0.013 $\rm{\AA}^{-1}$, and $E_F$ = 29$\pm$2 mV.  The deviation at large $B$ is consistent with a large $g^*\; (\sim 50)$~\cite{SI}. The field profiles of of $\rho_{xx}$ (inferred from $R_{14,23}$) in Sample J1 and J4, with $\bf B\parallel I$. The $N =0$ LL is entered at $B$= 6-8 T. The slight increase for $B>$ 5 T reflects the narrow width of the axial current. A slight misalignment of $\bf B$ (the uncertainty here is $\pm 1^\circ$) allows the $B$-linear positive MR component to appear as a background at large $B$.

The 3D Dirac semimetals, Na$_3$Bi and Cd$_3$As$_2$~\cite{Wang2012,Wang2013}, comprise two Dirac cones located at opposite positions in the Brillouin Zone (Fig. \ref{figWeyl}A). Ref.~\cite{Wang2012} has provided detailed calculations to show that each Dirac cone could be separated into both left- and right-handed (Weyl) states that do not mix~\cite{Burkov2011,Yang2011, Aji2012,Son2013,Parameswaran2014,Hosur2013} when the time-reversal symmetry (TRS) is broken by the magnetic field. Besides, an axial current that flows between the paired Weyl nodes could be induced while both $\bf E$ and $\bf B$ are present, and it results in the negative longitudinal magnetoresistance(LMR) in the semiclassical region as Son et.al.~\cite{Son2013} point out. Triggered by the above predictions, many experimental groups reported their negative MR results in different semimetals, such as  Bi$_{1-x}$Sb$_x$~\cite{Kim2013}, Cd$_3$As$_2$~\cite{Liang2015,Zhang2015a}, ZrTe$_5$~\cite{Li2014} and TaAs~\cite{Zhang2015}. However, we need to be cautious before reaching any conclusion because such negative MR exists in semimetals that are not Dirac or Weyl materials (e.g. Cd$_x$Hg$_{1-x}$Te~\cite{HgTe} and PdCoO$_2$~\cite{Kikugawa2014}). Thus it is important to identify a unique feature that could only be explained by the charge pumping effect and distinguishes the chiral anomaly from other effects in crystals. Below we will discuss a unique negative MR signature in Na$_3$Bi. We find that the enhanced conductance has a narrow plume shape whose direction is locked to the direction of $\bf B$. The enhancement that is steered by $\bf B$ suggests that it originates from the $\bf E\cdot \bf B$ pumping term.




%The intriguing possibility of observing the chiral (or axial) anomaly as a novel charge current in a crystal has been discussed since 1983~\cite{Nielsen}. In the field of topological phases of matter, this question has lately received intense interest in the context of Weyl semimetals~\cite{Ashvin,Balents,Son,Sid,Hosur}. [The anomaly first appeared as the dominant channel for the decay of the neutral pion into 2 photons $\pi^0\to 2\gamma$ (the Adler-Bell-Jackiw anomaly~\cite{Adler,Bell}). Subsequently, it has served broadly as a no-go test for the renormalizability of chiral gauge theories~\cite{Peskin,Zee}.]  To realize a Weyl semimetal, a promising path is to start with a 3D Dirac semimetal~\cite{Young,Bernevig}, and then split each Dirac node into a pair of Weyl nodes using a magnetic field $\bf B$. Rapid progress in identifying candidates for Dirac semimetals has been made~\cite{Young,Bernevig,Wang1,Wang2,Nagaosa}. The two semimetals specifically identified~\cite{Wang1,Wang2}, Na$_3$Bi and Cd$_3$As$_2$, were recently confirmed to be so by angle-resolved photoemission (ARPES)~\cite{Chen,Borisenko,Neupane,Liu,Suyang} and scanning tunneling microscopy~\cite{Yazdani}. Here we report the detection of the axial current in Na$_3$Bi as a highly collimated beam locked to the direction of $\bf B$.

A magnetic field $\bf B$ could split each Dirac node into two Weyl nodes with opposite chiralities $\chi=\pm 1$~\cite{Hosur2013,Wang2012} respectively. The Landau levels formed by these states are shown in Fig. \ref{figWeyl}B. One important feature in the LLs is that the lowest LL has a strict linear dispersion. And the chirality, which describes the handedness of the fermions, will determine whether the velocity is directed to the left or to the right. Therefore, it provides a solid-state platform to study the charge-pumping effect between electrons with different chiralities. In a combination of $\bf E$ and $\bf B$, the electrons' charge-pumping rate between the two chiral branches is
\be
W = \chi\frac{e^3}{4\pi^2\hbar^2} {\bf E\cdot B},
\label{eq:W}
\ee
which expresses the chiral anomaly~\cite{Burkov2011,Yang2011, Aji2012,Son2013,Parameswaran2014,Hosur2013}. When $\bf E$ and $\bf B$ are parallel, the pumping rate reaches the maximum. Ideally, such pumping effect generates a longitudinal (axial) current. However, different from high energy physics, the charge pumping effect in a crystal is relaxed by the intervalley scattering. A relaxation time approximation describes the scattering rate as $1/\tau_v = CeB/\hbar v$, i.e. proportional to the LL degeneracy~\cite{Aji2012}. As a result, in the quantum limit, although the pumping rate becomes larger, the increment of the scattering rate counteracts that of the pumping rate. Thus the conductivity $\sigma_\chi\sim W\tau_v$ becomes independent of $B$ in the quantum limit. When many LLs are occupied, the axial current remains observable although reduced. In the semiclassical weak-$B$ limit, Son and Spivak~\cite{Son2013} show that
\be
\sigma_{\chi} = \frac{e^2}{4\pi^2\hbar c}\frac{v}{c}\frac{(eBv)^2}{E_F^2}\tau_v.
\label{eq:SS}
\ee
In contrast to the quantum limit case, the field dependence of $\sigma_\chi$ follows a quadratic behavior instead of a constant. Hence, the whole field picture of $\sigma_\chi$ has a $B^2$ growth at weak fields and a $B$-independent saturation in the quantum limit.


As mentioned, the breaking of time-reversal symmetry (TRS) by $\bf B$ causes each Dirac node to split into two Weyl nodes~\cite{Fang2012,Wang2012,Wang2013}. The Weyl nodes, which may be regarded as monopole sources and sinks of Berry curvature in $\bf k$ space, come in pairs with opposite chiralities $\chi=\pm 1$. In the absence of an electric field $\bf E$, the two chiral populations are separately conserved (Fig. \ref{figWeyl}A). However, application of $\bf E$ ruins the conservation and leads to a charge-pumping process between nodes, corresponding to the chiral anomaly sketched in Fig. \ref{figWeyl}B~\cite{Nielsen1983,Wan2011,Burkov2011,Son2013,Parameswaran2014,Hosur2013}. As shown in Fig. \ref{figWeyl}A, the lowest Landau level (LL) of the Weyl states in a crystal is chiral. For $\chi = 1$ the lowest LL is right-moving (velocity $\bf v\parallel \bf {B}$), whereas for $\chi=-1$ it is left-moving~\cite{Nielsen1983,Wan2011,Burkov2011,Son2013,Hosur2013}. At steady state, $\bf E$ transfers charge from say the $\chi = -1$ branch to the $\chi= 1$ branch at the rate below:~\cite{Hosur2013}
\be
W = \chi\frac{e^3}{4\pi^2\hbar^2} {\bf E\cdot B}.
\label{eq:W}
\ee
The rate peaks for $\bf E\parallel B$ and vanishes when $\bf E\perp B$. In the weak-$B$ limit, a Berry curvature approach gives the chiral conductivity~\cite{Son2013} 
\be
\sigma_{\chi} = \frac{e^2}{4\pi^2\hbar c}\frac{v}{c}\frac{(eBv)^2}{\epsilon_F^2}\tau_v,
\label{eq:SS}
\ee
where $\tau_v$ is the intervalley life-time and $\epsilon_F$ the Fermi energy. 

%The Dirac semimetal Na$_3$Bi grows as mm-sized, deep-purple, plate-like crystals with the largest face parallel to the $a$-$b$ plane ($\bf \hat{c}$ is normal to the planes). We annealed the crystals for 10 weeks before opening the growth tube~\cite{Satya}. To avoid oxidation, crystals were contacted using silver epoxy  in an Argon glove box, and then immersed in paratone in a capsule before rapid cooling. In Na$_3$Bi, the Dirac nodes are located at the wave vectors $(0,0, \pm k_D)$ with $k_D \simeq 0.1\; \mathrm{\AA}^{-1}$~\cite{Chen,Suyang}. The predicted existence of surface Fermi arcs was recently confirmed~\cite{HasanFS}. Initial experiments in our lab~\cite{Xiong} on samples with a large Fermi energy $\epsilon_F$ (400 mV) showed only a positive MR with the anomalous $B$-linear profile reported in Cd$_3$As$_2$~\cite{Liang}. 
%
%
%In a field $\bf B||\hat{z}$, each Dirac node divides into two Weyl nodes of chirality $\chi=\pm 1$~\cite{Hosur,Wang1}. As shown in Fig. \ref{figWeyl}B, the states are quantized into LLs. Specific to Weyl states, however, the lowest LL ($N$=0) has a constant slope, with velocity directed either to the left or to the right, depending on $\chi$. This dichotomy is the crystal analog of the left and right-handed populations~\cite{Nielsen}. Application of $\bf E\parallel \bf B$ leads to charge-pumping of electrons between the two branches at the rate
%\be
%W = \chi\frac{e^3}{4\pi^2\hbar^2} {\bf E\cdot B},
%\label{eq:W}
%\ee
%which expresses the chiral anomaly~\cite{Nielsen,Ashvin,Balents,Ran,Aji,Son,Sid,Hosur}. In the presence of impurities, the longitudinal (axial) current relaxes via an intervalley scattering rate given by $1/\tau_v = CeB/\hbar v$, i.e. proportional to the LL degeneracy~\cite{Aji}. Hence, the chiral conductivity $\sigma_\chi\sim W\tau_v$ is independent of $B$ in the quantum limit. We emphasize that, when many LLs are occupied, the axial current remains observable although reduced. In the weak-$B$ limit and when $\bf E$ and $\bf B$ are parallel, Son and Spivak~\cite{Son} show that
%\be
%\sigma_{\chi} = \frac{e^2}{4\pi^2\hbar c}\frac{v}{c}\frac{(eBv)^2}{E_F^2}\tau_v.
%\label{eq:SS}
%\ee
%As $B$ increases, $\sigma_\chi$ grows as $B^2$, but saturates to a $B$-independent value in the quantum limit.



We have seen such a B dependence in the longitudinal magnetoresistance of our Na$_3$Bi samples when $\bf B\parallel\hat{x}\parallel E $. As shown in Fig. \ref{figWeyl}D, the resistivity $\rho_{xx}$ displays a large negative LMR ($\bf B\parallel\hat{x}\parallel I $, the current) at low temperatures. The resistance measured is $R_{14,23}$ (defined in Fig. \ref{figWeyl}C, inset and caption). $\rho_{xx}$ has a peak around $B=0$ T, and then has a sharp decrease until it becomes nearly field independent at higher fields. The peak is suppressed as $T$ increases above $\sim$100 K. In Fig. \ref{figSdH}C, the saturation of $\rho_{xx}$ (in Sample J1 and J4) happens above 5 T (the slight upturn at higher fields is a hint that the axial current is sensitive to misalignment of $\bf B$ at the level $\pm 1^{\circ}$). Such a large negative LMR is anomalous in a conventional conductor, even with band anisotropy (see below).

Then we hope to test whether this anomalous negative LMR arises from the chiral anomaly effect. Since the charge pumping rate is determined by a $\bf E\cdot \bf B$ term, it reaches the maximum when $\bf B$ is aligned with $\bf E$. We notice that the pumping rate only depends on the relative direction of $\bf E$ and $\bf B$ and does not care about the physical direction of them, when the field strengths are fixed. Thus a crucial test then is the demonstration that, the negative magnetoresistance (MR) pattern remains the same if $\bf E$ is rotated by 90$^\circ$. If it does, the axial current maximum is meant to be locked to $\bf B$ and $\bf E$, rather than being pinned to the crystal axes, even for weak $B$. Besides, we also need to test whether the axial current becomes smaller when $\bf B$ deviates from the direction of $\bf E$ with $\bf E$ fixed.

\caption{\label{figMR4}
Evidence for axial current in Na$_3$Bi (J4) obtained from transport measurements in an in-plane field $\bf B$. Panel A shows plots of the resistivity $\rho_{xx}$ vs. $B$ at selected field angles $\phi$ to the $x$-axis (inferred from resistance $R_{14,23}$, see inset). For $\phi$ = 90$^\circ$, $\rho_{xx}$ displays a $B$-linear positive MR. However, as $\phi\to 0^\circ$ ($\bf B||\hat{x}$), $\rho_{xx}$ is strongly suppressed. Panel B shows plots of $R_{35,26}$ with $\bf E$ rotated by 90$^\circ$ relative to Panel A ($\bf B$ makes angle $\phi'$ relative to $\bf\hat{y}$; see inset). The resistance $R_{35,26}$ changes from a positive MR to negative as $\phi'\to 0^\circ$. In both configurations, the negative MR appears only when $\bf B$ is aligned with $\bf E$. Panel C shows the conductance $G\equiv 1/R_{35,26}$. In weak $B$, it has the $B^2$ form predicted in Eq. \ref{eq:SS}~\cite{Son2013}. A fit to the parabolic form gives $\tau_v/\tau_{tr}$ = 40-60. Panel D shows curves of $\rho_{xx}$ (as in Panel A) extended to 35 T. Above 23 T, a knee-like kink appears at $H_k$. Above $H_k$, $\rho_{xx}$ increases very steeply (for $\phi >35^\circ$).}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}


Therefore, to carry out these tests, we first rotate $\bf B$ in the $x$-$y$ plane while still monitoring the resistance $R_{14,23}$ ($\bf E$ fixed to $\bf\hat{x}$ axis). Figure \ref{figMR4}A shows the resistivity $\rho_{xx}$ v.s. $B$ curves up to 9 T of Sample J4 measured at 4.5 K at selected $\phi$ (the angle between $\bf B$ and $\bf\hat{x}$). When $\phi = 90^\circ$ ($\bf B||\hat{y}$), the MR has an almost $B$-linear and positive shape as we observed in Cd$_3$As$_2$~\cite{Liang2015} and Na$_3$Bi~\cite{Xiong2015a} (as we discussed in previous sections ) with $\bf B||c$. As $\bf B$ rotates towards $\bf \hat{x}$ ($\phi$ decreased), the MR curves are pulled down towards negative values. When $\bf B$ and $\bf E$ are aligned ($\phi = 0$), the longitudinal MR has a rapid decrease and becomes fully negative (see below for the unsymmetrized curves, and results from J1).

To rotate $\bf E$, we then repeat the MR experiment \emph{in situ} with $I$ applied to the contacts (3, 5). Thus $\bf E$ is rotated by 90$^\circ$ (the measured resistance is $R_{35,26}$). Remarkably, the observed MR pattern is also rotated by 90$^\circ$, even when $B<$ 1 T. We define the angle of $\bf B$ relative to $\bf\hat{y}$ as $\phi'$, and then find that the MR curves at selected $\phi'$ (Fig. \ref{figMR4}A) have a similar behavior to those at various $\phi$. The LMR also becomes fully negative when $\phi'$ reaches 0. The curves in Panels A and B are nominally similar, except that $\phi$ and $\phi'$ describe different directions of $\bf B$ and $\bf E$, and $\phi = 0$ and $\phi'=0$ refer to $\bf\hat{x}$ and $\bf\hat{y}$, respectively. As we discuss below, it is a novel effect in conductors to have such a locking of the direction of the largest negative MR to the common direction of $\bf E\parallel B$. We identify it as a signature of the chiral anomaly.


A surprise to us is the acute sensitivity of the axial current to the misalignment of $\bf B$ and $\bf E$ at large $B$, as hinted at in Fig. \ref{figSdH}C. The slight misalignment of tiny degrees lead to the upcoming MR at high fields caused by scattering. To determine the angular dependence of $\sigma_\chi$, we measure $R_{14,23}$ at continuous tilt angles at a fixed $B$ with $\bf B$ either in the $x$-$y$ or the $x$-$z$ plane. Figures \ref{figPolar4}A and \ref{figPolar4}B display the curves of $\Delta\sigma_{xx}(B,\phi) \equiv \sigma_{xx}(B,\phi)- \sigma_{xx}(B,90^\circ)$ vs. $\phi$ ($\bf B$ in the $x$-$y$ plane at angle $\phi$ to $\bf\hat{x}$), when $B$ is fixed at 0.5$\to$2 T (Panel A) and 3$\to$7 T (B). Panels C and D show the same measurements except that $\bf B$ is in the $x$-$z$ plane at an angle $\theta$ to $\bf\hat{x}$. We find that angle dependence of $\Delta\sigma_{xx}$ at low fields has slightly sharper behavior than $\cos \phi$ (or $\cos \theta$). As displayed by the dashed curves in Fig. \ref{figPolar4}C and D, we could use a curve of $\cos^p\phi$ (or $\cos^p\theta$) with $p$ = 4 to reach a reasonably good fit to the observed low-field angular dependence. However, when $B$ grows larger than 2 T, the angular widths become significantly narrower. Hence, at large $B$, the axial current is observed as a strongly collimated beam in the direction selected by $\bf B$ and $\bf E$ as $\phi$ or $\theta$ is varied. We notice that current theoretical works that consider the MR modulation caused by the chiral anomaly effect, such as Ref. ~\cite{Son2013}, have only studied the case when $\bf B$ and $\bf E$ are parallel. A complete investigation of the MR enhancement at various angles is lacked. Also, due to the existence of the scattering term, $\Delta\sigma_{xx}$ may not simply follow the $\bf E\cdot \bf B$ term that describes the generated axial current. Since the strong collimation is unpredicted to our knowledge, we hope this experimental work could lead to more exploration on the conductivity enhancement caused by chiral anomaly effect when $\bf B$ and $\bf E$ are not parallel.

In Panels A and B, $\bf B$ lies in the $x$-$y$ plane at an angle $\phi$ to $\bf\hat{x}$ (sketch in insets). The 
conductance enhancement $\Delta \sigma_{xx}$ at fixed $B$ is plotted against $\phi$ for values of $B \le$ 2 T (Panel A) and for $3\le B\le 7$ T (Panel B). Fits to $\cos^4\phi$ (dashed curves), while reasonable below 2 T become very poor as $B$ exceeds 2 T. The insets show the polar representation of $\Delta \sigma_{xx}$ vs. $\phi$.

Curves of $\Delta \sigma_{xx}$ vs. $\theta$ for $B$ = 1, 1.5 and 2 T are shown in Panel C, while Panel D shows curves for $3\le B\le 7$ T. The axial current is peaked when $\phi\to 0$ (or $\theta\to 0$) with an angular width that narrows significantly as $B$ increases.

Another interesting part is that the negative MR is very large (as shown in Fig.\ref{figMR4}), which indicates a possible long relaxation time $\tau_a$. It is convenient to analyze the contribution of the axial current in conductance. We convert the resistivity into conductance in Fig. \ref{figMR4}C. When $\bf B$ and $\bf E$ are parallel, $G = 1/R_{35,26}$ follows a parabolic behavior that increases with $B$. The dramatic increase of $G$ indicates a long inter-valley relaxation time for the novel current. We fit Eq. \ref{eq:SS} to the $G$ v.s. $B$ curve at $\phi'=0$ in Fig. \ref{figMR4}C. Using the ratio $\sigma_{\chi}/\sigma_0 = \frac34 (k_F\ell_B)^{-4}.(\tau_v/\tau_{tr})$, where $\sigma_0$ is the Drude conductivity, $\ell_B$ is the magnetic length $\sqrt{\hbar/eB}$ and $\tau_{tr}$ the usual transport lifetime, we find that $\tau_v/\tau_{tr}$ = 40-60 in weak $B$. Such a large ratio between the two types of relaxation time implies that the inter valley relaxation rate $1/\tau_v$ of the novel axial current is anomalously lower than the scattering rate $1/\tau_{tr}$ of the conventional states in zero $B$. However, In the quantum limit, $\tau_v$ is strongly suppressed as $\sim 1/B$ because of the continuous increment in LL degeneracy so that $\sigma_\chi$ is $B$-independent, as discussed above (Fig. \ref{figSdH}C). 

To our knowledge, the matrix element $M$ in $1/\tau_a$ is not well studied despite its importance. Thus our data on Na$_3$Bi can provide a helpful direction for the study of the relaxation process of axial currents. Besides, there is a debate on whether a large node separation $2\delta k_N$ is needed to obtain a long $\tau_a$. In a DSM such as Na$_3$Bi, the Weyl nodes originally occupy the same point in the reciprocal space. But they can be split by a magnetic field. We estimate the separation induced by $\bf B$ in our Na$_3$Bi samples using the estimate of $g^* \sim 20$. We find that $\delta k_N > k_F$ when $B > 12$ T. Recently, however, it was shown\cite{Burkov2015} that the ratio $\tau_a/\tau_0$ can be very large (in a superlattice model) even for negligible $\delta k_N$ because the Berry curvature effects hinder the axial current relaxation and the chiral symmetry is only weakly violated. This issue should be resolvable by LMR experiments.

%Then we hope to estimate splitting speed of the Weyl nodes of a DSM in a magnetic field. This information is important because the charge pumping effect in a DSM is based on the prediction that Weyl nodes splitting is generated by breaking time reversal symmetry in the DSM. And the displacement of the Weyl node $\delta K$ from the Dirac node in a DSM is governed by $\delta K= \pm g^*\mu_B B/(\hbar v)$ (we will explain the details later). Assuming $g^*\sim50$ (roughly that in Cd$_3$As$_2$~\cite{Jeon2014}) and $v\sim 2\times 10^5$ m/s, we estimate that the Weyl spheres separate ($\delta K > k_F$) when $B>$ 6 T. This significant displacement is consistent with the steep increase in $\sigma_\chi$ in modest $B$.  




We also notice some interesting features in the high field part of $R_{14,23}$ up to $B$ = 35 T. As displayed in Fig. \ref{figMR4}D, at $H_{k}\sim$ 23 T when $\bf B||\hat{y}$, the slopes of the MR curves experience a sudden change. As $\bf B$ is tilted away from $\bf\hat{y}$ ($\phi\to \; 55^\circ$), the feature at $H_k$ becomes better resolved as a kink. The steep increase in $\rho_{xx}$ above $H_k$ may suggest an electronic instability at large $B$. However, as we decrease $\phi$ below $45^\circ$, $H_k(\phi)$ moves rapidly to above 35 T. The negative MR curves close to $\phi = 0$ remain unaffected by the instability up to 35 T (the small rising background is from a weak $B_z$ due to a slight misalignment and implies the strong collimation of the axial current). 

The above experimental can not be explained by conventional transport theory, and may give strong evidence for the chiral anomaly effect in Na$_3$Bi. Compared with the standard MR theory, the most surprising feature is the locking of the negative MR pattern to the $\bf B$ vector in Figs. \ref{figMR4}A and \ref{figMR4}B. The narrow plume feature in Fig. \ref{figPolar4} can not be interpreted as anisotropies in the FS properties ($v$ and $\tau_{tr}$ vs. $\bf k$) by the conventional transport theory, because otherwise the direction of maximum conductivity should be anchored to certain crystal axes. Nevertheless, our observation is consistent with the theoretical prediction of the chiral anomaly -- the axial current peaks when $\bf E$ is aligned with $\bf B$ even for weak fields. This unusual locking pattern in weak $B$ provides an essential signature of the charge pumping effect between the Weyl nodes, rather than merely the negative LMR. Our experiments confirm the $B^2$ behavior in the semiclassical weak $B$, which could provide measurement of both $\tau_v$ and $\tau_{tr}$. In the quantum limit, our data show that the enhancement of the conductance stops as the relaxation rate increases. The narrow angular dependence of the axial current, which is unexpected, may provide further insight into its unusual properties.

\subsection{Additional Results}

In previous sections, we have discussed our experimental evidence for the chiral anomaly effect in the Dirac semimetal Na$_3$Bi. Our main results above focus on Sample J4. In this section we also present supplemental information from Sample J4, and discuss similar results from a second sample J1. We adopt the same notation system as the one in our previous chiral anomaly section, i.e. $x$-$y$ axes and contact labels defined in the inset in Fig. \ref{figWeyl}C (and reproduced as an inset in Fig. \ref{J4Raw}A). To compare with the MR data of Na$_3$Bi, we also present the resistivity and conductivity tensors in a tilted $\bf B$ for a conventional one-band anisotropic metal. At the end, we calculate the Weyl node splitting as we mentioned in above sections.

Panel (A): The unsymmetrized MR data at 4.5 K derived from resistance $R_{14,23}$ (current $\bf{I}$ applied to the contacts (1,4) and voltage measured between contacts (2,3)). The inset shows the contact labels and the $x$ and $y$ axes fixed to the crystal. Panel (B): The unsymmetrized MR data based on resistance $R_{35,26}$. The raw data has a small antisymmetric part that we attribute to a small Hall signal inadvertently caused by misalignment between the field tilt plane and the crystal's $a$-$b$ face. Despite this small Hall signal, the negative MR is prominent in both cases when $\phi$ (or $\phi'$) is close to zero.}

\end{figure}

Many semimetals have a small carrier density $n$ and a high mobility ( e.g. $\mu>$ 20,000 cm$^2$/(Vs)). As observed in many of such semimetals, the magnitude of the Hall resistivity $\rho_{yx}$ can greatly exceed the longitudinal resistivity $\rho_{xx}$ (in the standard Hall configuration with current $\bf I||\hat{x}$ and $\bf B||z$). In most of our experiments, $\bf B$ is aligned to the $x$-$y$ plane as well as possible. In an ideal case, the Hall effect should be zero. Nevertheless, the experimental data show that  the field-antisymmetric Hall signal is often observed in the background and could be comparable to the resistive voltage above 10 Tesla. One explanation for the mixing is the misalignment of the sample's $a$-$b$ plane to the field rotation plane, thus unintentionally introducing a $z$ component to $\bf B$. Though the misalignment may be small, the remnant $\bf B_z$ could still generate a Hall component that is comparable to $\rho_{xx}$. Since the ideal MR curves are symmetric in field, the mixing of a Hall signal could easily be found from the antisymmetric part of the raw MR curves. A serious misalignment may result in a strong field anti-symmetric distortion in the raw MR curves, making them tilt dramatically towards, say, the $+B$ axis. This mixing effect could be a major source for the observed ``negative resistance'' ($E_{x}<0$ for $\bf I||\hat{x}$) sometimes encountered in semimetal magnetoresistance experiments performed in large $\bf B$. When not treated appropriately, such distortions may imitate a negative MR when the raw curves are symmetrized in field. 

Therefore, to rule out the above possibility of the apparent negative MR caused by Hall mixing, it is important to examine the raw MR curves as well. Here we display the raw MR curves (pre-symmetrization) in Fig. \ref{J4Raw}. They demonstrate that the distortion discussed above is a relatively weak effect in our experiment. Figure \ref{J4Raw}A displays the unsymmetrized raw MR curves measured in Sample J4 when the current $I$ is applied to contacts (1,4) (the measured resistance is $R_{14,23}$). Figure \ref{J4Raw}B shows the corresponding ``rotated'' curves when $I$ is switched to the contacts (3,5) (measured resistance $R_{35,26}$). In Panel A (B), $\phi$ ($\phi'$) denotes the angle between $\bf{B}$ and $\bf\hat{x}$ ($\bf\hat{y}$), same as the notation in the previous sections. The asymmetry of the MR curves in both panels is caused by a Hall ``pick up'' signal. However, the mixing Hall signal is apparently too small to generate the large, negative MR observed when $\bf B || \bf I$.

\caption{\label{J4Hall} The Hall effect data of J4 at different temperatures. The Hall curves at various temperatures reveal a clear signature of thermally excited holes at high temperatures. Above 70 K, the holes start to contribute to the Hall effect and they finally dominate the Hall signal above 140 K. The conductivity enhancement in MR also disappears around the same temperature range.}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{J4Hall} displays the temperature dependence of the Hall data in Sample J4 with $I$ applied to the contacts (1,4) and $\bf{B}$ parallel to the $c$-axis. The negative slopes at low temperatures indicate electrons' dominance at these temperatures. But when the temperature increases, the hole contribution grows rapidly. The hole contribution could be seen clearly even at a small $\bf{B}$ above 70 K, and it eventually dominates completely above 140 K. This hole excitation behavior is consistent with our estimation of the Fermi energy $\epsilon_F\sim$ 30 mV which is near the Dirac node (Fig. \ref{figWeyl}A). When $T$ is raised above 100 K, the steep increase of both electron and hole densities leads  to the occupation of higher Landau levels (which are not chiral), making the axial current difficult to resolve (Fig. \ref{figWeyl}D).

%\section{Magnetoresistance in Sample J1}
Below we will discuss the transport results on our second sample, J1, which shows behavior similar to that of J4. Sample J1 was crystallized within the same boule as J4. Fig.\ref{J1rho} displays J1's non-metallic $\rho-T$ dependence. As in J4, $\rho$ saturates at a peak below 10 K as the hole contribution is frozen out. The value of $\rho$ at 4 K is about 4$\times$ smaller than that in J4. 


The longitudinal magnetoresistance $R_{14,23}$ with $\bf B||\hat{x}$ are shown in Fig. \ref{J1MRT}. When $B$ $<$ 4 T, we observe a large negative MR peak centered at $B$=0 that gradually disappears when $T$ is raised from 3.5 to 120 K. This pattern is similar to the behavior observed in J4, as it hosts a large axial current in the lowest Landau level (LL) that becomes overwhelmed by contributions from higher LLs at increasing $T$. At very large $B$ ($>$ 20 T), the distortion from an unintended $z$ component $B_z$ becomes apparent in MR curves. 
Because the measurements on J1 preceded those performed on J4, we were unaware of the critical alignment conditions needed to isolate the anomalous axial current. Also as no two-axis rotator is available for our rotation measurement, the misaligned $z$ component of $\bf B$ is quite significant, even as the field is rotated in the nominal ``$x$-$y$'' plane.

\caption{\label{J1MR} Panel (A): Variation of the conductivity curves $\sigma_{xx}(\phi)$ vs. $B$ at selected tilt angles $\phi$ in Sample J1 at $T$ = 3.5 K. 
$\sigma_{xx}(\phi)$ is derived from measurements of $R_{14,23}$. As $\phi$ is rotated to close to 0, $\sigma_{xx}$ increases strongly as $B^2$ consistent with Eq. \ref{eq:SS}. We identify this with the axial current. 
Panel B shows the curves of $\rho_{xx}$ vs. $B$ measured in J1 at 3.5 K at selected tilt angles $\phi$ in fields up to 35 T. The profiles are similar to those shown in Fig. \ref{figMR4}D for Sample J4. A kink feature appears at $H_k$ in the rangle 30-35 T, above which $\rho_{xx}$ increases steeply. Here, the $\phi = 0$ curve (for J1) is also affected by $H_k$ (unlike in J4), possibly because of the larger misalignment in J1.

  \end{center}
\end{figure}

Fig. \ref{J1MR}A displays the conductivity $\sigma_{xx}$ v.s. $B$ curves (in J1) measured with $\bf B$ lying in the $x$-$y$ plane (at an angle $\phi$ to $\bf\hat{x}$). The curves are derived from measurements of $R_{14,23}$. As in Sample J4, the conductivity follows a strong $B^2$ enhancement when $\phi$ is close to 0, which is consistent with Eq. 2. In Panel B, we show the resistivity $\rho_{xx}$ v.s. $B$ curves measured up to 35 T. Similar to J4, the MR is large and positive when $\bf B$ is transverse to $\bf I$ (curves at 80$^\circ$), but becomes negative as $\phi\to 0$. We estimate the misalignment of the $a$-$b$ plane in J1 to be $(10\pm 3)^\circ$. Another consequence of the misalignment comes in above 30 T. As discussed previously, we observe a knee feature at the kink field $H_k\sim$ 30-35 T in Sample J4, above which $\rho_{xx}$ rises steeply. In J4, $H_k$ shifts strongly with $\phi$. When $\phi < 25^\circ$ it increases above 35 T (see Fig.\ref{figMR4}D). Hence the $\phi=0$ curve is unaffected. By contrast, $H_k(\phi)$ in Sample J1 has a milder variation vs. $\phi$ in Fig. \ref{J1MR}B. In particular, an upturn is observed above 30 T in the 0$^\circ$ curve. We interpret this as an implication of a non-negligible $B_z$ component in the measurement at $\phi$ = 0. 

Therefore, the main features of the MR curves reported for J4 in the previous section are also observed in J1. However, above 30 T, the larger misalignment of the crystal plane in J1 leads to an upturn in $\rho_{xx}$ that is not present in J4. Comparison of the MR results from J1 and J4 in the large-$B$ limit helps us estimate the angular width of the collimated beam associated with the axial current.

\subsection{Resistivity and Conductivity Tensors from Boltzmann Equation in a Tilted Magnetic Field}
In this subsection, we will show that the above MR results of our Na$_3$Bi samples at different directions of $\bf B$ are not expected from the conventional semiclassical, one-band transport theory in a tilted field. For a single anisotropic band, the Boltzmann equation is
\be
e{\bf E\cdot v}\frac{\partial f^0_{\bf k}}{\partial \epsilon_{\bf k}} + e{\bf v\times B}\cdot\frac{\partial g_{\bf k}}{\partial {\bf k}} 
= -\frac{g_{\bf k}}{\tau},
\label{Boltz}
\ee
with $e$ the charge, $\bf E$ the electric field, $\bf v = \partial\epsilon_{\bf k}/\hbar\partial {\bf k}$ the band velocity, $g_{\bf k}$ the leading correction to the equilibrium distribution function $f^0_{\bf k}$, and $\tau$ the relaxation time. Suppose the magnetic field is in the $x$-$z$ plane, i.e. ${\bf B} = (B_1, 0, B_3)$. Using the \emph{ansatz} with $\bf u$ the drift velocity
\be
g_{\bf k} = -{\bf u\cdot k}\frac{\partial f^0_{\bf k}}{\partial \epsilon_{\bf k}},
\ee
and the effective mass matrix
\begin{eqnarray}
\hat{m} = \left[   \begin{array}{ccc}
		m_1   &   0   &   0 \\
		0      &    m_2 &   0 \\
		0     &    0     &   m_3   \end{array}\right]
\end{eqnarray}
we can solve Eq. \ref{Boltz} to get the resistivity tensor ($n$ is the carrier density)
\begin{eqnarray}
\hat{\rho} = 
						\left[  	\begin{array}{ccc}
								\rho_1	&  -B_3/ne   &   0  \\
								B_3/ne  &   \rho_2   &   -B_1/ne \\
								0          &   B_1/ne   &   \rho_3   
								\end{array}
								\right].
				\label{rhoij}
				\end{eqnarray}
				

Inverting $\hat\rho$, we obtain the conductivity tensor 
\begin{eqnarray}
\hat{\sigma} = 
						\frac{1}{\Delta}\left[  	\begin{array}{ccc}
								\sigma_1(1+\mu_1\mu_3 B_1^2)  &  \sigma_1\mu_2B_3   &   \sigma_2\mu_1\mu_3 B_1B_3 \\
								 -\sigma_1\mu_2B_3									&   \sigma_2   									&   \sigma_2\mu_3B_1   \\
								\sigma_2\mu_1\mu_3 B_1B_3     &    -\sigma_2\mu_3B_1      &   \sigma_3(1+\mu_1\mu_2B_3^2)
								\end{array}
								\right]
				\label{Sij}
				\end{eqnarray}
where the zero-field conductivities and resistivities are defined by $\sigma_i = 1/\rho_i = ne\mu_i $ in terms of the anisotropic
mobilities $\mu_i = e\tau/m_i$. The determinant $\Delta$ equals $(1+\mu_2\mu_3 B_1^2+ \mu_1\mu_2 B_3^2)$.

An important conclusion of the above calculations is that, despite the anisotropy and the tilted field direction, the longitudinal resistivity 
$\rho_{xx}$ (the three diagonal terms) is strictly independent of $\bf B$ (meaning the Hall E-field perfectly balances the Lorentz force). In the limit $B_3\to 0$ (or $\theta\to 0$ in Fig. \ref{figPolar4}C,D), the longitudinal conductivity $\sigma_{xx}$ acquires a mild field dependence that vanishes if $\mu_1 = \mu_2 = \mu_3$. It never diverges as $1/\sin\theta$ or any other form.

Equations \ref{rhoij} and \ref{Sij} also apply to the geometry with $\bf B$ in the $x$-$y$ plane (Fig. 3 and Fig. 4A,B of main text) if we exchange the axes $y\leftrightarrow z$.


\subsection{Splitting of Generated Weyl Nodes of a Dirac Semimetal in a Magnetic Field}
In this subsection, we will discuss a crucial problem of 3D Dirac semimetals, i.e. how much shift can the Weyl nodes have in a magnetic field when they are generated from the Dirac nodes at zero field. To solve this problem,we leverage the model introduced by Wang \etal~\cite{Wang2012} (see also Jeon \etal~\cite{Jeon2014}), and estimate the shift in the Weyl nodes induced by the magnetic field $\bf B$ as follows. In a field $\bf B\parallel \hat{z}$, we have ${\bf k \to \Pi} = {\bf k} - e{\bf A}$, with the vector potential ${\bf A} = xB{\bf \hat{y}}$. The wavevector $\bf k$ is measured relative to the Dirac node. Neglecting the off-diagonal corrections in the full $4\times4$ Hamiltonian, the
$2\times2$ Hamiltonian for the ``up'' Weyl node has the form 
\begin{eqnarray}
H_+ = \hbar v\left[\begin{array}{cc}
						\Pi_z   &  \Pi_+   \\
						\Pi_-   &   -\Pi_z  
						\end{array}\right]
						-\mu_B B \left[\begin{array}{cc}
						g_s   &   0   \\
						0      &   g_p  
						\end{array}\right],
						\label{H1}
						\end{eqnarray}
where $\Pi_{\pm} = \Pi_x \pm i\Pi_y$ and $\mu_B$ is the Bohr magneton. Expressing the $g$-factors $g_s$ and $g_p$ (which are distinct) of the starting atomic orbitals $|S,\pm\rangle$ and $|P,\pm\rangle$ as $g_s = g_m + \delta g$ and $g_p = g_m - \delta g$, we have the Hamiltonian 
\be
H_+ = v{\bf \Pi\cdot }\boldsymbol{\tau} - g_m\mu_B B {\bf 1}- \delta g\mu_B B \tau_3,
\label{H2}
\ee
where $\tau_i$ are the Pauli matrices in orbital space.
By transforming the $\Pi_\pm$ to raising and lowering operators $a^\dagger$ and $a$, with $\ell_B$ the magnetic length,
\be
\Pi_+ = \frac{\sqrt{2} a^\dagger}{\ell_B}, \quad \Pi_- = \frac{\sqrt{2} a}{\ell_B}
\label{Pi}
\ee
we diagonalize $H_+$ to obtain the eigenenergy of the $n^{th}$ Landau level
\be
E_n(k_z) = -g_m\mu_B B \pm \sqrt{ \frac{2n\hbar^2 v^2}{\ell_B^2} + (\hbar vk_z -\delta g\mu_BB)^2}.
\label{En}
\ee
Setting the second term under the square root to zero, we obtain $\Delta k = \delta g\mu_B B/\hbar v$.
This is used in the main text to estimate the shift. 

The term $-g_m\mu_B B$ in Eq. \ref{En} leads to pronounced deviation of the index plot from a straight line if $|g_m|\gg 1$, consistent with the deviation in Fig. \ref{figSdH}.


\subsection{The Negative MR does not Origin from Localization}

The phenomenon of negative MR is a long-standing problem in metals. Although Anderson localization is arguably the most well-established theory for negative MR in 2D disordered metals, we believe it is irrelevant to the negative LMR in Na$_3$Bi. We discuss the reasons here.

First, we briefly review the salient facts about localization. We consider electrons diffusing in a disordered metal at very low $T$. The amplitude $\mathcal{A}$ for transmission between 2 points P and P$'$ is the sum of contributions over all Feynman paths linking P to P$'$. The subset of paths that self-intersect to form closed loops make singular contributions to $\mathcal{A}$ which decrease the conductivity $\sigma$ from its Drude value $\sigma_0$ in zero magnetic field. A modest field B suppresses the quantum corrections, restoring $\sigma_0$. Hence one observes a negative MR.

The diffusive nature of electrons moving in a sea of impurities dictates that the size L of a closed loop is generally $\gg$ $\ell$, the electron mean-free-path. In zero $B$, the 2 paths traversing a closed loop (clockwise v.s. anticlockwise) are exact time-reversed partners. Hence
wave packets following the two paths must interfere constructively when they return to the node regardless of $L$. Consequently, the amplitude for observing the electron at the node is enhanced, leading to Anderson localization. Because raising $T$ increases inelastic scattering by phonons (which destroys the quantum coherence), $L$ shrinks rapidly with increased $T$. As $T$ decreases, the quantum corrections lead to a resistance $R$ that increases as log$T$ in 2D. For 3D metals, $R$ varies as $T^{-n}$ (n = $\frac14$ $\to$ $\frac12$ ). In finite $B$, the constructive interference is suppressed once the magnetic flux in $L^2$ exceeds $\sim$ $\frac12$ a flux quantum $\phi_0$. As noted, this leads to a negative MR,with $\Delta R$ $\sim$ log$B$ in 2D. In 3D,$\Delta R$ $\sim$ $B^{-\frac12}$. In 2D metals, the characteristic field decreases from 100 G at 2 K to 20 G at 100 mK, as $L$ increases. Experimentally, 2D localization has been extensively investigated. In 3D metals, however, it has been difficult to observe in MR experiments. The corrections are weak presumably because Feynman paths in 3D rarely self-intersect.

The reasons why we believe localization is not relevant here are as follows:

First, we consider the $\rho$ v.s. $T$ profile in $B$ = 0 (Fig.\ref{figWeyl}C). As $T$ decreases from 300 K, $\rho$ rises by a factor of $\sim$ 12, but saturates to a constant below 25 K. The large variation $\Delta \rho$ between 30 and 100 K is matched by a large change in $R_H$, which implies that $\Delta \rho$ is actually driven by copious excitation of holes in a zero-gap semimetal rather than by Anderson localization (which should not be observable above a few K in 3D). The abrupt saturation below 25 K is also incompatible with localization which predicts that $\rho$ should increase with ever steeper slope as T $\to$ 0 K (as $L$ expands).

Second, the pronounced angular anisotropy of the axial current is incompatible with localization in a 3D metal. As shown in Figs. \ref{figMR4} and \ref{figPolar4}, the large negative MR is observed only when $\bf B$ is aligned to within 3-5\degree of $\bf I$. This highly anisotropic MR variation cannot be reconciled with 3D localization (the quantum interference effects underlying 3D localization imply that the negative MR should be isotropic in $\bf B$). Also, the negative MR persists to 90 K, far higher than the 2 K typical in 3D localization experiments.

Third, the overall change of $\rho_{xx}$ in the negative MR profile (Fig. \ref{J1MRT} and Fig. \ref{figWeyl}D of main text) is very large Ð
$\rho_{xx}$ decreases by a factor $>$ 5 at 4 K compared with a few \% in typical 2D localization experiments (in 3D, the change is even smaller). Quantitatively, we note that the field scale $B_{\omega}$ needed to suppress the peak in $\rho_{xx}$ is 3-4 T, compared with $<$100 Oe typical in localization experiments. If localization were indeed the cause of the negative MR, we would require typical loop size $L = \sqrt{\phi_0/2B_{\omega}} \simeq 25$ nm at 4 K, but such an L would be far too small to produce the observed 5$\times$ change in $\rho_{xx}$. Moreover, this $L$ implies a very short $\ell$ which is inconsistent with the measured mobility ($\mu$ = 2600 cm$^2$/(Vs) at 4 K).
