abstract = {When electrons are confined in two-dimensional materials, quantum-mechanically enhanced transport phenomena such as the quantum Hall effect can be observed. Graphene, consisting of an isolated single atomic layer of graphite, is an ideal realization of such a two-dimensional system. However, its behaviour is expected to differ markedly from the well-studied case of quantum wells in conventional semiconductor interfaces. This difference arises from the unique electronic properties of graphene, which exhibits electron-hole degeneracy and vanishing carrier mass near the point of charge neutrality. Indeed, a distinctive half-integer quantum Hall effect has been predicted theoretically, as has the existence of a non-zero Berry's phase (a geometric quantum phase) of the electron wavefunction--a consequence of the exceptional topology of the graphene band structure. Recent advances in micromechanical extraction and fabrication techniques for graphite structures now permit such exotic two-dimensional electron systems to be probed experimentally. Here we report an experimental investigation of magneto-transport in a high-mobility single layer of graphene. Adjusting the chemical potential with the use of the electric field effect, we observe an unusual half-integer quantum Hall effect for both electron and hole carriers in graphene. The relevance of Berry's phase to these experiments is confirmed by magneto-oscillations. In addition to their purely scientific interest, these unusual quantum transport phenomena may lead to new applications in carbon-based electronic and magneto-electronic devices.},

abstract = {Topological insulators are a new class of insulators in which a bulk gap for electronic excitations is generated because of the strong spin-orbit coupling inherent to these systems. These materials are distinguished from ordinary insulators by the presence of gapless metallic surface states, resembling chiral edge modes in quantum Hall systems, but with unconventional spin textures. A key predicted feature of such spin-textured boundary states is their insensitivity to spin-independent scattering, which is thought to protect them from backscattering and localization. Recently, experimental and theoretical efforts have provided strong evidence for the existence of both two- and three-dimensional classes of such topological insulator materials in semiconductor quantum well structures and several bismuth-based compounds, but so far experiments have not probed the sensitivity of these chiral states to scattering. Here we use scanning tunnelling spectroscopy and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy to visualize the gapless surface states in the three-dimensional topological insulator Bi(1-x)Sb(x), and examine in detail the influence of scattering from disorder caused by random alloying in this compound. We show that, despite strong atomic scale disorder, backscattering between states of opposite momentum and opposite spin is absent. Our observations demonstrate that the chiral nature of these states protects the spin of the carriers. These chiral states are therefore potentially useful for spin-based electronics, in which long spin coherence is critical, and also for quantum computing applications, where topological protection can enable fault-tolerant information processing.},

@article{Hsieh08,
abstract = {When electrons are subject to a large external magnetic field, the conventional charge quantum Hall effect dictates that an electronic excitation gap is generated in the sample bulk, but metallic conduction is permitted at the boundary. Recent theoretical models suggest that certain bulk insulators with large spin-orbit interactions may also naturally support conducting topological boundary states in the quantum limit, which opens up the possibility for studying unusual quantum Hall-like phenomena in zero external magnetic fields. Bulk Bi(1-x)Sb(x) single crystals are predicted to be prime candidates for one such unusual Hall phase of matter known as the topological insulator. The hallmark of a topological insulator is the existence of metallic surface states that are higher-dimensional analogues of the edge states that characterize a quantum spin Hall insulator. In addition to its interesting boundary states, the bulk of Bi(1-x)Sb(x) is predicted to exhibit three-dimensional Dirac particles, another topic of heightened current interest following the new findings in two-dimensional graphene and charge quantum Hall fractionalization observed in pure bismuth. However, despite numerous transport and magnetic measurements on the Bi(1-x)Sb(x) family since the 1960s, no direct evidence of either topological Hall states or bulk Dirac particles has been found. Here, using incident-photon-energy-modulated angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (IPEM-ARPES), we report the direct observation of massive Dirac particles in the bulk of Bi(0.9)Sb(0.1), locate the Kramers points at the sample's boundary and provide a comprehensive mapping of the Dirac insulator's gapless surface electron bands. These findings taken together suggest that the observed surface state on the boundary of the bulk insulator is a realization of the 'topological metal'. They also suggest that this material has potential application in developing next-generation quantum computing devices that may incorporate 'light-like' bulk carriers and spin-textured surface currents.},

Using Mott polarimetry, we probed the spin degrees of freedom and demonstrated that topological quantum numbers are completely determined from spin texture-imaging measurements. Applying this method to Sb and Bi(1-x)Sb(x), we identified the origin of its topological order and unusual chiral properties.

abstract = {Surfaces of topological insulators host a new class of states with Dirac dispersion and helical spin texture. Potential quantum computing and spintronic applications using these states require manipulation of their electronic properties at the Dirac energy of their band structure by inducing magnetism or superconductivity through doping and proximity effect. Yet, the response of these states near the Dirac energy in their band structure to various perturbations has remained unexplored. Here we use spectroscopic mapping with the scanning tunneling microscope to study their response to magnetic and non-magnetic bulk dopants in Bi2Te3 and Bi2Se3. Far from the Dirac energy helicity provides remarkable resilience to backscattering even in the presence of ferromagnetism. However, approaching the Dirac point, where the surface states' wavelength diverges bulk doping results in pronounced nanoscale spatial fluctuations of energy, momentum, and helicity. Our results and their connection with similar studies of Dirac electrons in graphene demonstrate that while backscattering and localization are absent for Dirac topological surface states, reducing charge defects is required for both tuning the chemical potential to Dirac energy and achieving high electrical mobility for these novel states.},

abstract = {The three dimensional (3D) Dirac semimetal, which has been predicted theoretically [1], is a new electronic state of matter. It can be viewed as 3D generalization of graphene, with a unique electronic structure in which conduction and valence band energies touch each other only at isolated points in momentum space (i.e. the 3D Dirac points), and thus it cannot be classified either as a metal or a semiconductor. In contrast to graphene [2], the Dirac points of such a semimetal are not gapped by the spin-orbit interaction and the crossing of the linear dispersions is protected by crystal symmetry [1]. In combination with broken time-reversal or inversion symmetries, 3D Dirac points may result in a variety of topologically non-trivial phases with unique physical properties [1, 3-5]. They have, however, escaped detection in real solids so far. Here we report the direct observation of such an exotic electronic structure in cadmium arsenide (Cd3As2) by means of angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). We identify two momentum regions where electronic states that strongly disperse in all directions form narrow cone-like structures, and thus prove the existence of the long sought 3D Dirac points. This electronic structure naturally explains why Cd3As2 has one of the highest known bulk electron mobilities [6]. This realization of a 3D Dirac semimetal in Cd3As2 not only opens a direct path to a wide spectrum of applications, but also offers a robust platform for engineering topologically-nontrivial phases including Weyl semimetals and Quantum Spin Hall systems.},

abstract = {We present a study of “nodal-semimetal” phases in which nondegenerate conduction and valence bands touch at points (the “Weyl semimetal”) or lines (the “line-node semimetal”) in three-dimensional momentum space. We discuss a general approach to such states by perturbation of the critical point between a normal insulator (NI) and a topological insulator (TI), breaking either time-reversal (TR) or inversion symmetry. We give an explicit model realization of both types of states in a NI-TI superlattice structure with broken TR symmetry. Both the Weyl and the line-node semimetals are characterized by topologically protected surface states, although in the line-node case, some additional symmetries must be imposed to retain this topological protection. The edge states have the form of “Fermi arcs” in the case of the Weyl semimetal: these are chiral gapless edge states, which exist in a finite region in momentum space, determined by the momentum-space separation of the bulk Weyl nodes. The chiral character of the edge states leads to a finite Hall conductivity. In contrast, the edge states of the line-node semimetal are “flat bands”: these states are approximately dispersionless in a subset of the two-dimensional edge Brillouin zone, given by the projection of the line node onto the plane of the edge. We discuss unusual transport properties of the nodal semimetals and, in particular, point out quantum critical-like scaling of the dc and optical conductivities of the Weyl semimetal and similarities to the conductivity of graphene in the line-node case.},

abstract = {The last decade has witnessed great advancements in the science and engineering of systems with unconventional band structures, seeded by studies of graphene and topological insulators. While the band structure of graphene simulates massless relativistic electrons in two dimensions, topological insulators have bands that wind non-trivially over momentum space in a certain abstract sense. Over the last couple of years, enthusiasm has been burgeoning in another unconventional and topological (although, not quite in the same sense as topological insulators) phase – the Weyl semimetal. In this phase, electrons mimic Weyl fermions that are well known in high-energy physics, and inherit many of their properties, including an apparent violation of charge conservation known as the chiral anomaly. In this review, we recap some of the unusual transport properties of Weyl semimetals discussed in the literature so far, focusing on signatures whose roots lie in the anomaly. We also mention several proposed realizations of this phase in condensed matter systems, since they were what arguably precipitated activity on Weyl semimetals in the first place. Ces dix derni\`{e}res ann\'{e}es ont vu la r\'{e}alisation de grandes avanc\'{e}es dans la connaissance et la manipulation de syst\`{e}mes pr\'{e}sentant des structures de bandes non conventionnelles. Ces avanc\'{e}es ont \'{e}t\'{e} stimul\'{e}es par lʼ\'{e}tude du graph\`{e}ne et des isolants topologiques. Tandis que la structure de bande du graph\`{e}ne simule le comportement des \'{e}lectrons relativistes sans masse, les isolants topologiques poss\`{e}dent des bandes qui « sʼenroulent » de mani\`{e}re non triviale (dans un certain sens abstrait) autour de lʼespace des impulsions. Au cours de ces derni\`{e}res ann\'{e}es, lʼenthousiasme sʼest aussi port\'{e} vers une autre phase non conventionnelle et topologique : le semi-m\'{e}tal de Weyl. Dans cette phase, les \'{e}lectrons adoptent le comportement des fermions de Weyl, bien connus en physique des hautes \'{e}nergies, et h\'{e}ritent de leurs propri\'{e}t\'{e}s, dont une violation apparente de la conservation de la charge : lʼanomalie chirale. Dans cette revue, nous r\'{e}capitulons certaines des propri\'{e}t\'{e}s de transport des semi-m\'{e}taux de Weyl discut\'{e}es dans la litt\'{e}rature jusquʼ\`{a} maintenant, en insistant plus particuli\`{e}rement sur les signatures de lʼanomalie chirale.

abstract = {Condensed-matter systems provide a rich setting to realize Dirac and Majorana fermionic excitations as well as the possibility to manipulate them for potential applications. It has recently been proposed that chiral, massless particles known as Weyl fermions can emerge in certain bulk materials or in topological insulator multilayers and give rise to unusual transport properties, such as charge pumping driven by a chiral anomaly. A pair of Weyl fermions protected by crystalline symmetry effectively forming a massless Dirac fermion has been predicted to appear as low-energy excitations in a number of materials termed three-dimensional Dirac semimetals. Here we report scanning tunnelling microscopy measurements at sub-kelvin temperatures and high magnetic fields on the II-V semiconductor Cd3As2. We probe this system down to atomic length scales, and show that defects mostly influence the valence band, consistent with the observation of ultrahigh-mobility carriers in the conduction band. By combining Landau level spectroscopy and quasiparticle interference, we distinguish a large spin-splitting of the conduction band in a magnetic field and its extended Dirac-like dispersion above the expected regime. A model band structure consistent with our experimental findings suggests that for a magnetic field applied along the axis of the Dirac points, Weyl fermions are the low-energy excitations in Cd3As2.},

Several novel transport properties in a magnetic field have been proposed for Dirac semimetals. Here, we report a property of Cd3As2 that was unpredicted, namely a remarkable protection mechanism that strongly suppresses backscattering in zero magnetic field. In single crystals, the protection results in ultrahigh mobility, 9 × 10(6) cm(2) V(-1) s(-1) at 5 K. Suppression of backscattering results in a transport lifetime 10(4) times longer than the quantum lifetime. The lifting of this protection by the applied magnetic field leads to a very large magnetoresistance.

Moreover, a TDS can potentially be driven into other exotic phases (such as Weyl semimetals, axion insulators and topological superconductors), making it a unique parent compound for the study of these states and the phase transitions between them. Here, by performing angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we directly observe a pair of 3D Dirac fermions in Cd3As2, proving that it is a model 3D TDS. Compared with other 3D TDSs, for example, $\beta$-cristobalite BiO2 (ref. ) and Na3Bi (refs , ), Cd3As2 is stable and has much higher Fermi velocities.

This effect, found in ferromagnets, depends on the orientation of the magnetization with respect to the electric current direction in the material. At room temperature, the anisotropic resistance in alloys of Ni-Fe and Ni-Co can be greater than 5\%. The theoretical basis takes into account spin orbit coupling and d band splitting. Other properties such as permeability, magnetostriction, and Hall voltage have no simple relationship to magnetoresistance. Anisotropic magnetoresistance has an important use as a magnetic field detector for digital recording and magnetic bubbles. Such detectors because of their small size are fabricated using thin film technology. Film studies show that thickness, grain size, and deposition parameters play a significant role in determining the percentage change in magnetoresistance. In general, the change is smaller in films than bulk materials. Several tables and graphs that list bulk and film data are presented.},

abstract = {We investigate novel phases that emerge from the interplay of electron correlations and strong spin-orbit interactions. We focus on describing the topological semimetal, a three-dimensional phase of a magnetic solid, and argue that it may be realized in a class of pyrochlore iridates (such as Y2Ir2O7) based on calculations using the LDA+U method. This state is a three-dimensional analog of graphene with linearly dispersing excitations and provides a condensed-matter realization of Weyl fermions that obeys a two-component Dirac equation. It also exhibits remarkable topological properties manifested by surface states in the form of Fermi arcs, which are impossible to realize in purely two-dimensional band structures. For intermediate correlation strengths, we find this to be the ground state of the pyrochlore iridates, coexisting with noncollinear magnetic order. A narrow window of magnetic “axion” insulator may also be present. An applied magnetic field is found to induce a metallic ground state.},

abstract = {Symmetry or topology protected Dirac fermion states in two and three dimensions constitute novel quantum systems that exhibit exotic physical phenomena. However, none of the studied spin-orbit materials are suitable for realizing bulk multiplet Dirac states for the exploration of interacting Dirac physics. Here we present experimental evidence, for the first time, that the compound Na3Bi hosts a bulk spin-orbit Dirac multiplet and their interaction or overlap leads to a Lifshitz transition in momentum space - a condition for realizing interactions involving Dirac states. By carefully preparing the samples at a non-natural-cleavage (100) crystalline surface, we uncover many novel electronic and spin properties in Na3Bi by utilizing high resolution angle- and spin-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements. We observe two bulk 3D Dirac nodes that locate on the opposite sides of the bulk zone center point \$\backslash Gamma\$, which exhibit a Fermi surface Lifshitz transition and a saddle point singularity. Furthermore, our data shows evidence for the possible existence of theoretically predicted weak 2D nontrivial spin-orbit surface state with helical spin polarization that are nestled between the two bulk Dirac cones, consistent with the theoretically calculated (100) surface-arc-modes. Our main experimental observation of a rich multiplet of Dirac structure and the Lifshitz transition opens the door for inducing electronic instabilities and correlated physical phenomena in Na3Bi, and paves the way for the engineering of novel topological states using Na3Bi predicted in recent theory.},

Owing to the nontrivial topology of electronic wave functions, the 3D Dirac SM shows nontrivial physical properties and hosts various exotic quantum states such as Weyl SMs and topological insulators under proper external conditions. There are several kinds of Dirac SMs proposed theoretically and partly confirmed experimentally, but its unified picture is still missing. Here we propose a general framework to classify stable 3D Dirac SMs in systems having the time-reversal, inversion and uniaxial rotational symmetries. We show that there are two distinct classes of 3D Dirac SMs. In one class, the Dirac SM possesses a single Dirac point (DP) at a time-reversal invariant momentum on the rotation axis. Whereas the other class of Dirac SMs have a pair of DPs created by band inversion, and carry a quantized topological invariant.},

This axial current is the chiral (Adler-Bell-Jackiw) anomaly investigated in quantum field theory. We report the observation of a large, negative longitudinal magnetoresistance in the Dirac semimetal Na3Bi. The negative magnetoresistance is acutely sensitive to deviations of the direction of B from E and is incompatible with conventional transport.

abstract = {Chiral anomaly is a non-conservation of chiral charge pumped by the topological nontrivial gauge field. As an analogy to the similar phenomenon in high-energy physics, the chiral anomaly in condensed matter is predicted to exist in the emergent quasiparticle excitations in Dirac and Weyl semimetals. However, the current understanding of such concept mostly remains in the theoretical consideration, which lacks of convincing experimental identification. Here, for the first time, we experimentally observe the existence of the chiral anomaly and the related valley transport in Cd3As2. We find that the chiral imbalance induced by external electric and magnetic fields leads to a non-zero gyrotropic coefficient \{$\backslash$gamma\}, which can be confirmed by the field-generated Kerr effect. By applying B along the current direction, we observe a negative magnetoresistance despite the giant positive one at other directions, a clear indication of the chiral anomaly. Remarkably, a robust nonlocal response from valley diffusion originated from the chiral anomaly is observed up to room temperature when B is parallel to E. Our discovery of the chiral anomaly in Cd3As2 Dirac semimetal opens up a brand-new route to understand its fundamental properties with a controllable chiral imbalance through external fields and utilize the chiral fermions in valleytronic applications.},

abstract = {It is shown that Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations in SrTiO$_3$ d-doped with La can be understood as arising from a two-dimensional electron gas of one subband immersed in the space charge layer. Despite the inherent complexity of a subband that is derived from four d-band states near the conduction-band minimum of SrTiO3, the quantum oscillations can be modeled quantitatively by recognizing that the magnetic field (B) induced effective spin splitting and Landau-level splitting are comparable. The oscillations are not strictly periodic in 1/B, which can be understood as caused by a weak dependence of the electron density on the magnetic field in the subband that produces the observed oscillations.},

abstract = {A topologically ordered material is characterized by a rare quantum organization of electrons that evades the conventional spontaneously broken symmetry-based classification of condensed matter. Exotic spin-transport phenomena, such as the dissipationless quantum spin Hall effect, have been speculated to originate from a topological order whose identification requires a spin-sensitive measurement, which does not exist to this date in any system. Using Mott polarimetry, we probed the spin degrees of freedom and demonstrated that topological quantum numbers are completely determined from spin texture-imaging measurements. Applying this method to Sb and Bi(1-x)Sb(x), we identified the origin of its topological order and unusual chiral properties. These results taken together constitute the first observation of surface electrons collectively carrying a topological quantum Berry's phase and definite spin chirality, which are the key electronic properties component for realizing topological quantum computing bits with intrinsic spin Hall-like topological phenomena.},

abstract ={Recent theory predicted that the quantum spin Hall effect, a fundamentally new quantum state of matter that exists at zero external magnetic field, may be realized in HgTe/(Hg,Cd)Te quantum wells. We fabricated such sample structures with low density and high mobility in which we could tune, through an external gate voltage, the carrier conduction from n-type to p-type, passing through an insulating regime. For thin quantum wells with well width d < 6.3 nanometers, the insulating regime showed the conventional behavior of vanishingly small conductance at low temperature. However, for thicker quantum wells (d > 6.3 nanometers), the nominally insulating regime showed a plateau of residual conductance close to 2e2/h, where e is the electron charge and h is Planck's constant. The residual conductance was independent of the sample width, indicating that it is caused by edge states. Furthermore, the residual conductance was destroyed by a small external magnetic field. The quantum phase transition at the critical thickness, d = 6.3 nanometers, was also independently determined from the magnetic fieldinduced insulator-to-metal transition. These observations provide experimental evidence of the quantum spin Hall effect.},

abstract = {Weyl fermions are massless chiral fermions that play an important role in quantum field theory but have never been observed as fundamental particles. A Weyl semimetal is an unusual crystal that hosts Weyl fermions as quasiparticle excitations and features Fermi arcs on its surface. Such a semimetal not only provides a condensed matter realization of the anomalies in quantum field theories but also demonstrates the topological classification beyond the gapped topological insulators. Here, we identify a topological Weyl semimetal state in the transition metal monopnictide materials class. Our first-principles calculations on TaAs reveal its bulk Weyl fermion cones and surface Fermi arcs. Our results show that in the TaAs-type materials the Weyl semimetal state does not depend on fine-tuning of chemical composition or magnetic order, which opens the door for the experimental realization of Weyl semimetals and Fermi arc surface states in real materials.},

Using photoemission spectroscopy, we directly observe Fermi arcs on the surface, as well as the Weyl fermion cones and Weyl nodes in the bulk of TaAs single crystals.

An archetypal correlated material is vanadium dioxide (VO2), which is insulating only at temperatures below a characteristic phase transition temperature. We show that electrolyte gating of epitaxial thin films of VO2 suppresses the metal-to-insulator transition and stabilizes the metallic phase to temperatures below 5 kelvin, even after the ionic liquid is completely removed. We found that electrolyte gating of VO2 leads not to electrostatically induced carriers but instead to the electric fieldinduced creation of oxygen vacancies, with consequent migration of oxygen from the oxide film into the ionic liquid. This mechanism should be taken into account in the interpretation of ionic liquid gating experiments.},
