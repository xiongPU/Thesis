\section{Hamiltonian and Chirality of the Weyl Nodes in Na$_3$Bi}
\label{sec:na3bi:hamiltonian}

We first introduce the Dirac Hamiltonian and the chirality in Na$_3$Bi as described in \cite{Wang2012}. The strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in Bi  leads to a band inversion of $\sim$0.5 eV. Such a large inversion produces band crossings of the $s$ and $p$ states along the $\Gamma-A$ or (001) direction in Na$_3$Bi. Because the states belong to different irreducible representations, they cannot hybridize. This results in protected Dirac nodes at K± = (0, 0, ±kD ). In Na$_3$Bi, the states that are relevant to the calculations are the Na-3$s$ states (in the conduction band) and the Bi-6$p_x$ and Bi-6$p_y$ states (in the valence band).
