\section{Summary}
\label{sec:na3bi:summary}


We have discussed our transport study of two types of Na$_3$Bi crystals in this chapter. The first type of Na$_3$Bi has a high $E_F$ and displays a linear MR when $\bf B$ is perpendicular to $\bf I$. The Hall angle of these samples display a step-function behavior and indicates that the transport lifetime is surprisingly sensitive to the magnetic field. In the second type, $E_F$ is close to the Dirac point and we have observed a negative longitudinal magnetoresistance when $\bf B$ is parallel to $\bf E$. Such negative LMR follows a quadratic $B$ dependence as proposed by the theoretical prediction for the axial current induced between Weyl fermions \cite{Son2013}. In addition, the negative LMR can be lifted with a very small deviation of the $\bf B$ direction. The chiral anomaly effect in a WSM or DSM is predicted to cause a dependence to the angle between $\bf B$ and $\bf E$. But the previous theoretical study has not given a formula for the angular sensitivity of the caused negative LMR. The ultra sensitivity we observed here may inspire future study of the suppression and scattering mechanism of the axial current in a WSM and DSM.
